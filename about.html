      <p>
        The Magnavox Odyssey console was created because Ralph H. Baer
        had a vision of bringing interactive video games into the home.
        It was released in September 1972 to allow people to play games
        on their televisions for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a commercial success because it introduced the idea of
        home video games; although it wasn’t a massive success.

        The first PlayStation console was released in Japan on
        December 3, 1994. It emerged after a <strong>failed deal between</strong>
        Sony and Nintendo to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super Nintendo.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the negotiations failed, Sony decided to create its own
        console, <strong>The Console</strong>, to compete in the 32-bit video
        game console market.

        Sega emerged from the arcade industry after World War II.
        Its history began in 1940 with Standard Games, founded in
        Hawaii to provide entertainment for American soldiers through
        coin-op machines on military bases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company later moved to Japan under the name Service Games of Japan,
        continuing its mission of providing entertainment to the armed forces
        in 1960.
